Based on our previous discussion, we have decided on several things as to how Rhey Yuri will spend his internship with regards to modules that need improvement, and we have agreed with the following paths:

  

1. Login Improvements - this tackles security improvements, especially on 2FA, etc.
2. Variants V2

  

Now as per boss, we should decide what tasks will be assigned to Rhey Yuri, considering that:

    1. He has a limited time for internship
    2. Whatever he will work on, he should be able to see its application on the platform (implying that what he should work on should not be that big; it should be doable within 12 weeks \[I believe its now 9-10 weeks left\])
    3. Whatever he will work on, it should be consistent and all other tasks should be within that module (if he works on Login improvements, he will stick to that Login module until the end of his internship)

  

So, here are some tasks I found on the Endorsed to BA folder that might suit Rhey Yuri:

* Merchant & Customer | Sign Up | Change placeholder for password confirmation field (Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/860t4kuvp](https://app.clickup.com/t/860t4kuvp)))

* Customer Side | Sign In/Up | Check varying title for the same field (Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/860t4krmx](https://app.clickup.com/t/860t4krmx)))

* 31\. Merchant Side| Customer Side | Product Information | Set short description character limit (Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/865c8tx6r](https://app.clickup.com/t/865c8tx6r)))

* Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/86epzkn6g](https://app.clickup.com/t/86epzkn6g))

If you have any other tasks in mind that you think we can assign to Rhey Yuri, any suggestions are welcome!

  

P.S. I can't find the task for Login Improvements regarding security huhu
